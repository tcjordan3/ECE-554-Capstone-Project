                <div class="timeline-content">
                    The idea for the project originated from our collective interest in creating an interactive dance game powered by FPGA technology. We wanted to design a system that could provide a responsive, real-time gaming experience using motion tracking and video processing.

                <h5>2. Architecture Design</h5>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    The architecture design focused on creating an efficient and scalable system. We decided on using FPGA to implement the core components of the game, such as motion tracking and processing. The architecture was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for easy integration with peripherals and video processing.

                <h5>3. Microarchitecture Design</h5>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    In the microarchitecture phase, we focused on optimizing the key components to meet the real-time requirements. The main challenge was balancing performance with resource usage. We designed the system to leverage high-throughput data paths while maintaining low latency.

                <h5>4. Individual Work on Components</h5>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    The work was split between team members, with each person taking responsibility for different components. Shantanu worked on the peripherals, Paridhi focused on the DTW algorithm, and Tyler worked on the CORDIC and cluster modules. The DTW architecture was based on the paper "High-Throughput DTW accelerator with minimum area in AMD FPGA by HLS," which we later optimized by 150x in speed and 98.5% in size.

                <h5>5. Integration and Testing</h5>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    Once the individual modules were ready, we integrated them and started simulation testing. We compared the output of the FPGA system with the Python script we had written for DTW. During integration, we faced timing issues, with some modules running slower than expected. This required us to synchronize the modules and optimize the timing further.

                <h5>6. Synthesis and Timing Check</h5>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    After integration, we performed synthesis and timing checks. This phase revealed some issues with the timing of the system, and we had to make adjustments to ensure everything fit within the available resources on the FPGA.

                <h5>7. Beanie and Gloves Search</h5>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    As part of the design, we needed to find a funky-colored beanie and gloves that the dancer could wear without confusing the game. The color contrast was critical, so we made sure that the dancer wouldn't be wearing items that could interfere with the motion tracking.

                <h5>8. Mapping Beanie and Gloves</h5>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    Once we found the beanie, we mapped it to specific pixel colors for tracking purposes. However, the camera's sensitivity to lighting made this process difficult. Even slight changes in lighting would cause the color to shift drastically, which required several trials and adjustments to find the correct parameters.

                <h5>9. Fixed Scoring Delay</h5>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    Initially, there was a delay of about 1:30 minutes after the dance before the score was calculated. We identified the cause of the delay and made optimizations to ensure that the score was calculated in real-time after the dance finished.

                <h5>10. Bought Gloves and Cable Issue</h5>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    We purchased the gloves and mapped them for motion tracking. However, during testing, we encountered a problem with the UART cable, which was used to synchronize the reference video with the player's start. Unfortunately, the cable blew up, and we had to remove the automatic reference video feature.

                <div class="timeline-content">
                    After all the technical issues were addressed, we wrapped up the project with some final touches, ensuring everything was working seamlessly. We also prepared for the final demonstration of the system.
